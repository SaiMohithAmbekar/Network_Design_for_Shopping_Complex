# Network Design for Shopping Complex

Computer networks have a significant impact on the working of an organization. Shopping Complexes nowadays depend on the proper
functioning and analysis of their networks for payment, billing/invoices, communication, helpdesk services, checking availability of items etc.
An efficient network is essential to facilitate the systematic and cost-efficient transfer of information in an organization in the form of messages,
files, and resources. The project provides insights into various concepts such as topology design, IP address configuration, and how to send
information in the form of packets to the wireless networks of different areas of a shopping complex.
The aim of this project is to design the topology of the shopping complex network using the software Cisco Packet Tracer with the
implementation of wireless networking systems. 

This network consists of the following devices:
1) Router (Generic)
2) Switches (Generic)
3) Wireless Router
4) Tablets
5) Smartphones
6) Copper straight through cable
7) Serial DTE cable
